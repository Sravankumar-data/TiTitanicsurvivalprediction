# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository presents a **machine learning project** to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using historical data.

## 📂 Dataset

The included file, `Titanic-Dataset.csv`, contains details about each passenger:

- 🆔 **PassengerId**: Unique passenger identifier
- 💡 **Survived**: Outcome (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- 🎟️ **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Name**: Passenger's name
- ⚧️ **Sex**: Gender
- 🎂 **Age**: Age in years
- 👪 **SibSp**: # of siblings/spouses aboard
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Parch**: # of parents/children aboard
- 🪪 **Ticket**: Ticket number
- 💲 **Fare**: Passenger fare
- 🚪 **Cabin**: Cabin number
- 🛳️ **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## 🔎 Project Workflow

- **Data Exploration** 📊  
  Analyze characteristics affecting survivability, such as class, gender, age, and family connections.

- **Data Preprocessing** 🧹  
  Clean missing data (especially Age and Cabin), encode categorical variables, and prepare for modeling.

- **Feature Engineering** 🏗️  
  Create and transform features to boost predictive performance.

- **Modeling** 🤖  
  Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree) to predict survival.

- **Evaluation** 📈  
  Assess model performance and interpret results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3 🐍
- pandas & numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib & seaborn (data visualization) 📊
